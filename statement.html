      <p>Before explaining what my three main goals are in Digital media Art, I should make it clear how it was that I became interested in this career in the first place. 
A few years ago, studying art was not my first option. I started studying careers that were more focused on science and mathematics, but I never liked them enough to stay in them, since I didn't enjoy them and I didn't feel like wanting to spend my whole life working on something related to numbers or formulas. I felt that no matter where I went or what I chose I would be confined to just following a pre-defined line. I had never considered art before, because I believed that to study something like that required great drawing skills, which I don't have yet. It was right there when I saw a commercial about art majors and discovered the kinds of things that could be accomplished by studying such careers.  What mainly led me to choose the major of Digital Media Art above all else was the freedom you can have to work on your projects. You do not necessarily need to be a Leonardo Da Vinci and draw a Monalisa out of your imagination, what you need is to demonstrate a broad understanding and planning of the message you want to express using the most appropriate materials and elements and have good skill with some editing program like Photoshop. I am pleased to say that I am happy with the results in the portfolio that I am delivering. That was one of my first goals (one step at a time), since the portfolio is the window to show others the artist's capabilities. However, I know there is still room for improvement for me. I never believed that I could achieve in just one semester but having a good mentoring like I had in my first semester at the University of San Jose I know this is just the beginning. My second goal would be to take advantage of Career related clubs. These clubs will be very useful to form connections in addition to the classes that I take for semester.
Finally, I do not want to come here and say that my maximum goal is to be the best and to start my millionaire company after graduating. What I do want to make clear is that my main goal in this Career is to learn as much as I can from my mistakes as well as the mistakes or weaknesses of the work and the ideas of my classmates, teachers and also what I can do to overcome the different problems that someone could encounter when we want to deliver a message with our art.
